<h1>Do You Know Da Way?</h1>
<p>Do you know da way? *Clicks tongue* For the queen, we go strong in unity. 
  We do not stop, even when the journey is long and the sands are many. 
  We spit on those who do not show us da way. 
  Da wisdom of da tribe, it keeps us strong, we move in circles, for we do not falter.</p>

<p>We hold da strength of our bruddahs and sistahs. For da queen! We know da strength comes not from da muscle but from da spirit. 
  Many may try to run alone, but da way is found together. 
  Clarity comes from the journey, not da destination. We do not stray from da way. 
  Do you feel it? *Clicks tongue*</p>

<p>Unity, strength, and da way. It binds us. Da circle of bruddahs is our home, our spirit, our strength. 
For those who do not know da way, they are lost. We will show them da way, through hardship and strength, for da queen. 
Do you know da way?</p>
